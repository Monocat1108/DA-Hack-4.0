## 1. How WorkHere Is Different (Inspiration)

Many students struggle to find a good study environment and often want a study partner or group to keep them productive. While apps exist for restaurants, coworking spaces, or social networking, none focus specifically on **student study needs + community building**.

**WorkHere is different because it:**
- Focuses on **student-specific study filters** (WiFi, outlets, noise, hours).
- Helps users **connect with study groups** in real time.
- Uses a **data-driven model** to recommend optimal study spots.
- Encourages a **community of feedback and shared reviews.**
